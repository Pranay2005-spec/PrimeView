# PrimeView 🎬

**PrimeView** is an online movie streaming website — one of my first full web projects built during college. This project showcases a complete dynamic web application using core web technologies, and it was a great hands-on way for me to learn back-end and front-end development. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
